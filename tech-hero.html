    <h3>About Issra Omer</h3>
    <p>
      Issra Omer is a Product Director at Spotify, where she leads the Freemium experience and strategy. 
      In this role, she helps decide what features free users can access and what is reserved for paid subscribers, 
      a position that carries a lot of influence over how people interact with the platform. She also played a major 
      role in bringing the lyrics feature to Spotify, something that millions of users rely on every day. Before joining Spotify, 
      Omer worked at Meta and built her career in product management after studying at Stanford. Learning about her is important 
      in a class on code, power, and intersectionality because her story shows how identity and leadership overlap in the tech world.<br><br>
      As a woman of color in product management, she represents voices that are often missing in these spaces, and her work shows 
      how product decisions can shape culture, access, and visibility on a massive scale. For us, we decided that Issra Omer 
      is our favorite tech hero because we like what she stands for and how she uses her position to make technology more inclusive. 
      She is not only building features that millions of people use, like Spotifyâ€™s lyrics tool, but she is also shaping decisions 
      about access through her leadership on the Freemium experience. In a field where Black women are underrepresented, Omer shows 
      that leadership in tech can look different and that those perspectives matter when products influence culture and visibility 
      on such a large scale.
