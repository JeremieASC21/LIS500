    </ul>

    <p>
      This article is important because it shows how implicit bias shapes the way people think about technology.
      It explains that many assume new technology is always better, that tools seem more trustworthy when they act human,
      and that technology is often seen as a male space. These ideas connect to intersectionality because they reinforce
      existing inequalities about who is included, who gets to lead, and whose voices matter in tech.
      It reminds us that bias is not only about people but also about how we view and use technology.

  <!-- Intersectionality Section -->
  <section>
    <h2>Intersectionality</h2>
    <p>
      Intersectionality is a framework for understanding how various forms of inequality and discrimination overlap and intersect.
      It recognizes that individuals can experience multiple, overlapping identities (such as race, gender, sexuality, and class)
      that shape their experiences and perspectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the context of technology and society, intersectionality is crucial for understanding how biases can be compounded
      and how different groups may be affected in unique ways by technological advancements.
    </p>

    <h2>Implicit Bias</h2>
    <p>
      Implicit bias refers to the unconscious attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions.
      These biases can influence how we perceive and interact with others, often without our awareness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In technology, implicit bias can manifest in various ways, such as in the design of algorithms, user interfaces,
      and even in workplace cultures. Recognizing and addressing implicit bias is essential for creating more inclusive
      and equitable technological solutions.
